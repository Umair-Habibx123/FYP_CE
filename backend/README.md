## Backend Overview

The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, with **MongoDB** as the database. It includes:

- `models/`: MongoDB schemas and models.
- `routes/`: API routes and controllers.
- `.env`: Environment variables for the backend.

### Running the Backend Separately

```bash
cd backend
nodemon index.js
```
