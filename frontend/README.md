## Frontend Overview

The frontend is built using **React** with **Vite** for fast development. It includes:

- `public/`: Static assets like images and HTML files.
- `src/`: React components, styles, and application logic.
- `.env`: Environment variables for the frontend.

### Running the Frontend Separately

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
